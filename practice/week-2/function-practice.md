# Function Practice
### Create a function called `square` that takes a number as an argument and returns the square
__SAMPLE INPUT__
```
square(2)
4
```

### Create a function called `say_hello` that takes a name as input and says hello to that name
```
say_hello("Benny")
"Hello, Benny!"
```

### Create a function called `string_counter` that accepts two arguments, a string and an optional second string. The function should return the number of times the second string appears in the first string. If the second string is not passed to the function, the function should count the number of times the letter "a" appears in the first string.
```
string_counter("hello world", "world")
1
```
```
string_counter("aaaaa")
5
```

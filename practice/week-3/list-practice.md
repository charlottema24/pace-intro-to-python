# List Practice
## Part 1
* Create a list called `animals` that has 3 different animals
* Print each element of your list using both positive and negative integers
* Print the length of the list
* Create a function called `return_first_element` that accepts a list as an argument and returns the first element of the list
* Create a function called `return_last_element` that accepts a list as an argument and returns the last element of the list
* Add an animal to the list using the `append()` function
* Add another anmial to the beginning of the list using the `insert` function
* Remove the third animal on the list using either pop or del


## Part 2
### Exercise 3-8, Page 46 of Python Crash Course
* Think of at least 5 places in the world you'd like to visit
* Store the locations in a list, make sure the list is not in alphabetical order
* Print your list in its original order
* Use `sorted()` to print your list in alphabetical order
* Print the original list again -- ensure it is still in the original order
* Use `sorted()` with the optional argument `reverse` to to print your list in reverse alphabetical order
* Print your list again to ensure you haven't changed the original order
* Use `reverse` to change the order of your list
* Use `reverse` again to put it back to its original order
* Use `sort()` to store your list in alphabetical order and then print the list
* User `sort` to change your list so its stored in reverse alphabetical order

### Week Three Warm Up

* Create a function called `shout` that accepts a single string argument and prints the string plus an exclamation point

``` 
shout("hello")
HELLO!

should("loud noises")
LOUD NOISES!

* Add an optional argument that allows you to change the punctuation at the end. If no argument is given, it will default to an exlamation point

shout("hello")
HELLO!

shout("how are you", punc="?")
HOW ARE YOU?

# Return Values Practice
### Create a function called `add_xyz` that accepts three arguments `x, y, z` and returns their sum
```
def add_xyz(x, y, z):
  # Your code here!
```
### Create a function called `square` that takes a number as an argument and returns the square
__SAMPLE INPUT__
```
a = square(2)
print(a)
# this should output the following

```
### Using the square function you have created, print the result of 2 squared plus 3 squared

# this should output the following
13
```
### Create a function called `get_formatted_name` that has two arguments, `first_name` and `last_name` and returns the full name neatly formatted:

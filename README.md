## Instructions for Submitting Weekly Homework Assignments
* Create a clone of this repository on your desktop using the [Github Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/)
* Create a new branch named using the week number and your Github username. For example, for Week 2 assignments, I would use `git checkout -b week2-julienisbet`
* Create a new file in the Weekly folder using the same naming convention `week2-julienisbet.py`
* Create a Pull Request for that week's assignment
* Look at other students solutions and comment on their pull requests

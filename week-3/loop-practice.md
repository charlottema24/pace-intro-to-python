# Loop Practice

* Use the range function to create a list of all odd numbers between 100 and 200
* What is the sum of all digits between 1 and 1 million?
* Using range and a for loop, print all multiples of 3 between 3 and 30
* Using `range(1, 11)`, create a list called squares that contains the squares of every integer between one and 10

* Last week we wrote a program that accepted two inputs and output the area of a rectangle. Modify that program to now accept a single input, with the values separated with a space

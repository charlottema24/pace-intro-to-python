# Input Practice
#### Create a program that accepts a name as input and then says hello

__SAMPLE INPUT__
```
Julie
```

__SAMPLE OUTPUT__
```
Hello, Julie!
```

#### Create a program that accepts 2 integers representing height and width and returns the area of the rectangle

__SAMPLE INPUT__
```
4
9
```

__SAMPLE OUTPUT__
```
36
```

#### Create a program that asks for a person's name and eye color then prints them back to them

__SAMPLE INPUT__
```
Julie
blue
```

__SAMPLE OUTPUT__
```
Hello. Please enter your name
<first input>
Thank you, please enter your eye color.
<second input>
Hello, Julie. You have blue eyes.
```

### Extra Problems
* Modify your program for returning area of a rectangle to instead return the area of a triangle
* Modify your program for returning the area of a rectangle so that instead of the input being two consecutive integers, it accepts a single input with the two integers separated by a space. How would you process this input to still return the area of the rectangle?
__SAMPLE INPUT__
2 4
* Similarly, modify your program that prints name and eye color to only accept a single input value
